## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Quizathon! Colour Palette](/readme-docs/Quizathon!%20palette.png)

The website uses a palette of pastel primary colours in order to look inviting whilst not being too garish. A gradient background with coloured buttons on a white quiz area gives a splash of colour but keeps things from being too loud or causing eye strain. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Keeping in line with the subtle but friendly theme, the Quicksand font has been selected to be used throughout the application.

### Page Layout

Wireframes were created based on the initial design of the page layout for various screen sizes. The final deployed application has some minor changes/additions, for example the button layout on laptops is now horizontally lined up instead of in a grid layout,a progress bar has been added below the score buttons, and a replay button has been added to the modal. However, the overall design is still largely aligned with the initial wireframes. Wireframes shown below:

(Still to be edited): The tab, Alt tab and enter allow a user to participate without a mouse. Potential future release could be for the user to enter choice by pressing A B C D or Alt and the letter to select their choice on a keyboard
